# Paper Assignments
* The process for each question accounts for <font color=green>80%</font>, while the answer accounts for <font color=green>20%</font>. If the process is missing, <font color=red>no score will be given</font>.
* Paper-based assignments must clearly include student ID, name, question numbers, and process details. If not clearly filled out, the assignment will not be graded and will receive a score of <font color=red>0</font>.
* For true/false questions, all answers must explain the reasoning for errors. Failure to provide an explanation will be treated as a missing calculation process.
* Different units or chapters must be submitted separately and cannot be combined into a single document.
* If more than one unit or chapter is written, binding is required.

## Submission Rules
* **Paper Size:** Limited to `A4` single-sided. Please print and write according to the [template](https://github.com/Yucheng0208/NTUT-Linear-Algebra-Course-TAs-Sample-Code/tree/main/113-2/Assignments_Sample).
* **Writing Guidelines:** Use block letters, and indicate the following in the corresponding fields:
    1. Assignment number.
    2. Unit number.
    3. Question number (including copying exercise question numbers).
    4. Copy the question (only the algebra and matrix notation).

* **Submission Time:**

# Programming Assignments
* **Functionality execution** accounts for <font color=green>80%</font>, and **documentation** accounts for <font color=green>20%</font>. Missing comments will result in <font color=red>no score</font>.
* Programming assignments must include both the source code and documentation. Missing documentation will result in a <font color=orange>50%</font> penalty, while missing source code will result in a score of <font color=red>0</font>.

## Submission Format
1. Compress the `source code`, `documentation`, and (for Python) `requirements.txt` into a single `.zip` file.
2. Name the zip file using the following convention: `{AssignmentName}_{YourName}.zip`. Example: `PA1_Shih-HsuanYang.zip`.

> :loudspeaker: **Notes**
> * The documentation must include instructions on how to execute the code, execution steps, and results.
> * Do not use `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, or other compression formats.
> * For any questions, contact [Yu-Cheng Chang](https://hackmd.io/@Yucheng208/NTUT-Linear-Algebra/%2FH1kAnwzv1x#Yu-Cheng-Chang).
> * <font color=red>Failure to comply with regulations will result in no score.</font>
